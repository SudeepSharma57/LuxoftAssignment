 - After successful clone, main(master) code will be checkout, now click on Branch option. Now on opened pop-up it will show current branch as master from which next branch will be create, and type the branch name as 'Sudeep-1234', choose commit option as 'Working copy parent', and click on 'Checkout new branch' and click on 'Create Branch'
